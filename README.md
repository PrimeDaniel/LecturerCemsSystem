## System Capabilities

- **Test Creation:** Lecturers can create and manage a database of questions and tests relevant to the courses they teach. The system uniquely identifies each question and test.
- **Test Performance:** Students receive and submit tests through the system interface. The system records the solution duration and allows lecturers to lock the test anytime.
- **Test Grading:** The system auto-grades tests according to predefined data. Lecturers can review and manually change grades if necessary. Upon confirmation, the system notifies the students about their grades.
- **Data Processing:** The system calculates statistical data for each test and performs an automatic check for identical errors.

## User Roles and Access
- **Students:** Can see their test scores and receive a copy of the graded test.
- **Lecturers:** Can create tests, grade them, and receive statistical analysis of all tests they created.
- **Head of the Department:** Can approve changes, access all data in a read-only mode, and receive statistical information from the system. You can also change live tests time.

## Technologies Used

- **Java/JavaFX:** The core logic of the CEMS system is implemented in Java.GUI was built with the help of the JavaFX library,

- **FXML/CSS:**  The user interface is built using FXML and CSS.
FXML structures the content and is connected through controllers to JavaFX, and CSS is for custom styles.

- **SQL/MySQL:** The system uses MySQL as the database management system to store and retrieve all data,
- **Git/Github:** I chose Git as version control, and Github to host our project.
